Assignment: CSS Basics & The Box Model
Overview
This project serves as a hands-on assignment to demonstrate a foundational understanding of CSS. It covers key concepts such as linking external stylesheets, applying basic styling properties like color and font-size, and, most importantly, a practical application of the CSS Box Modelâ€”the core principle governing layout and spacing on the web.

Objective
The goal of this assignment was to create a clean, well-structured HTML page and style it using an external styles.css file. The primary focus was on showcasing how margin, padding, and border properties work together to control the size, spacing, and layout of elements on a page.

Files Included
index.html: The main HTML file containing the content structure of the page. It includes a header, a main container with various sections, and a footer. It's properly linked to the external stylesheet.

styles.css: The external stylesheet containing all the CSS rules. It is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of different sections and selectors. This file applies all the styling, including typography, colors, and the Box Model examples.

README.md: This file, which provides a brief overview of the project, its objectives, and the files included.

Key Concepts Demonstrated
External Stylesheet Linkage: The <link> tag is used in index.html to correctly connect the styles.css file.

CSS Selectors: The project uses various selectors, including element selectors (body, h1), class selectors (.container, .button-primary), and descendant selectors (.main-header h1).

Basic Styling Properties: Properties like font-family, background-color, color, and font-size are used to style the page's appearance.

The CSS Box Model:

Padding: Applied to elements like .card-section and .box to create space between the content and the border.

Border: A visible border is added to .box elements to define their boundaries.

Margin: Used on the .container and .box elements to create space between different elements and sections, demonstrating how elements are pushed away from each other.

Code Readability: The CSS code is organized into logical sections with clear comments and consistent indentation to ensure maintainability and ease of understanding.

How to Run
Ensure both index.html and styles.css are in the same directory.

Open index.html in any modern web browser.

The page should load with all the styles applied, visually demonstrating the concepts outlined in the assignment.
