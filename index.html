            <h2>The Foundation of Web Design</h2>
            <p>
                Every element on a webpage is a box. Understanding this fundamental concept, known as the CSS Box Model, is the key to creating predictable and beautiful layouts. This page demonstrates how we use padding, borders, and margins to control the size and spacing of elements, turning a simple structure into a visually appealing design.

            <div class="card box-model-card">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The content area is where your text, images, and other media live. It's the innermost part of the box. Its size can be controlled with the `width` and `height` properties.

            <div class="card box-model-card padding-demo">
                <h3>Padding</h3>
                <p>
                    Padding is the space between the content and the border. It's used to give your content breathing room and is part of the element's background.

            <div class="card box-model-card border-demo">
                <h3>Border</h3>
                <p>
                    The border is a line that wraps around the padding and content. It's a key part of an element's visual appearance and can be styled in various ways.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card box-model-card margin-demo">
                <h3>Margin</h3>
                <p>
                    Margin is the space outside the border. It creates a buffer zone between this element and other elements on the page, pushing them away.

                    <p>
                        By combining the Box Model with flexible units and media queries, we can create layouts that look great on any device, from a large desktop monitor to a small mobile phone.

                    <p>
                        CSS is also used to style interactive elements like buttons and forms. We can add transitions and hover effects to provide better user feedback.
